- **To pass a semester**, the average grade from scientific/technical subjects (excluding sports and foreign languages, etc.) must be **at least 10/20**.  
- **Sports and foreign languages also need to be passed**, but they **are not included in the “scientific” average** – the minimum passing grade is also **10/20**.  
- **To pass the year**, you must pass both semesters.  

**There are no courses that last an entire year or half a semester** – every course is assigned to a single semester. Even if a course continues in the next semester, it **changes its name** and you have to pass it as **two separate parts**.  

**Is it easy to pass?** At first glance, the system may seem pleasant (especially the weighted grading structure ), **but it is important to know that:**

- **It is much harder to get a high grade** – the grading system is structured so that **15/20 is considered a good grade**, and **20/20 is practically impossible**. Grades are scaled to fit a certain distribution.  
- **There are no two or three exam sessions** – if you fail **semester 1**, the **resits are only in June**, together with the resits for **semester 2**. This happens because semester 2 begins immediately after the semester 1 exams.  
- **Not attending an exam (ET or parciel) means failing the entire year!**  

**This means that:** if you don’t attend an exam, you receive the status *“défaillant”*, which automatically equals failing the year. The only exceptions are medical certificates or extraordinary personal situations. This also means that being absent from a *parciel* does not result in a 0/20 grade that you could later balance out – you simply fail.  

Stressful? Maybe a bit ;) For me, this system has both advantages and disadvantages.
