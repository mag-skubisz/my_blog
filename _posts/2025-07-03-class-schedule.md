The schedule in my program looks more or less like this:  

On average, we have **4.5 hours of classes per day**, but this varies a lot. In the first semester, for example, I had **an extra day off**, while on another day I had more classes. On the other hand, **since the beginning of this semester I have about 6 hours a day**.  

Classes are divided into:  
- **CM** (*cours magistraux*) – lectures  
- **TD** (*travaux dirigés*) – tutorials (solving exercises, written assignments, etc.)  
- **TP** (*travaux pratiques*) – practical sessions (in my case mainly programming)  

In my program and track, the **distribution of hours is roughly ⅓ CM, ⅓ TD, ⅓ TP**. (This semester we have many more lectures, while previously I only had them for one subject).  

The daily schedule is **quite well balanced**:  
- **Maximum of 6 hours per day**  
- **Classes start between 8:00 and 11:15** (3 hours of classes + a 15-minute break)  
- **Then a lunch break**, and from **13:30 to 16:45** another block of classes  
- **If we have fewer classes on a given day**, the time block does not change – it just means that either the morning or afternoon block is empty. (From what I checked, it’s the same in L2 and L3 for my program, and similar for other programs at my faculty)  

Even though we have **a lot of classes, the schedule is well distributed**. A big advantage is that the **timetable is published at the beginning of the semester** for the entire semester and **practically does not change** (in the first semester, only **two class times** were rescheduled).  

This allows us to **plan our time better**, since we immediately know which days are free. At the start of the semester, we are also given **exam dates, project deadlines**, etc.
