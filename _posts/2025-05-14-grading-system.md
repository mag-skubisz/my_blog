Grades are given on a scale from **0 to 20**. Throughout the year there are several different assessment methods:

- **ET (Examen Terminal)** – final exam, held at the end of each semester.  
- **Parciel** – midterm exams, testing material from the first half of the semester.  
- **CC (Contrôle Continu)** – chapter-based tests, often organized in the middle of a half-semester.  
- **Projects** – assessment based on long-term project work.  
- **TP (Travaux Pratiques)** – practical work carried out during lab sessions.  
- **QCM / Quick** – short 15-minute quizzes checking ongoing knowledge.  

The **final grade** in a given subject is a weighted average of different forms of assessment. Here are some examples of weightings in specific courses:

- **MAT201**: max(15% CC1 + 15% CC2 + 30% parciel + 40% ET, ET)  
- **INF201**: 60% ET + 20% (quick + project) + 20% parciel  
- **INF203**: max(30% parciel + 20% project + 50% ET, ET)  
- **INF202**: 20% TPs + 20% parciel + 60% ET … and so on  

As you can see, not all forms of assessment are present in every subject. For example, **TP** is graded only in two of my courses, but in other courses we also have practical sessions (TP) that are just *pass/fail*. This usually means you have to submit the completed tasks at the end of the class or by the end of the week (often these are simply small weekly projects).
