UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes offers a wide variety of events, most of them designed to help students socialize and discover the city.  
Popular activities include **mountain trips** (Grenoble is surrounded by mountains, so this is a classic choice ), **cycling tours**, **parties**, and **gatherings in bars, cafÃ©s, or in the EVE building (*Espace Vie Ã‰tudiante*)**.  
Every Monday, for example, you can join the *CafÃ© Tandem* â€” an event where students practice French, English, and many other languages together.  

Occasionally, there are also organized trips to nearby cities such as **Annecy** or **Geneva**, and every year during the holiday season, students can take part in a special trip to the **Christmas market in Strasbourg**.  

Some events are more unique and memorable, like *BuddyNight*, *StartUGA*, evening barbecues (the one I joined was organized by my department â€” DLST), or even a special outdoor screening of *Joker* in the amphitheater to celebrate the release of its sequel ðŸŽ¬.

ðŸ’¡ **Golden tip:**  
Take part in as many of these events as you can!  
They turn your university experience into something much richer than just studying â€” helping you build friendships, memories, and a sense of belonging.
