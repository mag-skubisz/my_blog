It is true that studying in a foreign language can sometimes be a “challenge” that requires additional effort, especially at the beginning of your studies when you still need to get used to it. However, I believe this effort is absolutely worth it, because studying in a foreign language quickly and effectively develops your language skills.

Since the beginning is always the hardest, it is really worth making sure you are well prepared linguistically. To start your studies, you will definitely need at least the DELF B2 level. You pass with 50/100, but in my opinion, even if you score 100/100, it will not prepare you perfectly for the level that daily life in France will require of you (though it is of course sufficient to manage, so don’t worry).

From my own experience: I passed this exam in May with 92/100, and in August I left for France. I won’t hide that it was tough (in general, but also linguistically). I think the mistake I made was completely stopping my French practice after the exam. That’s why one of my **golden tips** is (no, not cramming all summer, but...) to use the opportunities your language level already gives you. Watch a French movie you like, read a book, or listen to podcasts to get used to the language and reduce the stress that may appear in the first weeks of your stay.  

This is meant to be a relaxed practice, and you should not treat it like homework, but as a pleasure.
