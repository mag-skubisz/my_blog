After receiving a response from the university and completing your administrative enrollment, itâ€™s worth preparing thoroughly for the trip.  
Make sure to carefully check which documents you will need in France and which ones require translation into Polish.  

Itâ€™s also a good idea to book flights well in advance (mainly because of prices).  
**I recommend planning your arrival at least one or two weeks before the start of the academic year.**  
The first days can be very tiring and stressful, so itâ€™s important that they donâ€™t overlap with your first university classes.  

During this period, you will need to pick up your student card, attend your pedagogical meeting, and you will probably take part in many integration events, which I strongly recommend joining to adapt more quickly to the new environment and to make friends and connections.

**The most important things before departure:**
1. **Transport** (flight, shuttle buses, public transport)  
2. **Preparation of documentation**  
3. **Familiarization with procedures** to complete upon arrival in France  
   (available on the university website or on Parcoursup)  

During this stay, you will need to pick up your student card, attend your pedagogical meeting, and you will probably take part in many integration events, which I strongly recommend joining to adapt more quickly to the new environment and to make friends and connections.

ðŸ’¡ **Golden tip:**  
Plan out your **first week** in detail.  
Set aside specific days for:  
- visiting the university,  
- attending student events,  
- participating in information meetings (e.g., about jobs, medical documentation).  

This way, youâ€™ll feel less lost during those first days and have a clear plan to fall back on. ;)
